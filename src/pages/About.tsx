        I create nice and functional things across multiple platforms. While I have extensive
        experience with UX/UI design and coding, I also work on projects related to brand identity.

      <Paragraph big className="mb-16 px-6 sm:px-8 md:px-12">
        I value both creative and personal freedom, preferring remote and flexible work. Family time
        is a non-negotiable, and I put high priority in my time off, enjoying mountain biking,
        hiking and travelâ€”whether with family or solo when needed.
