        I create nice and functional things across multiple platforms. While I have extensive
        experience with UX/UI design and coding, I can also tackle assignments in identity, print,
        and photography.

      <Paragraph big className="mb-16 px-6 sm:px-8 md:px-12">
        I value both creative and personal freedom, preferring remote, flexible, and non-corporate
        work. Family time is a non-negotiable, and I put high priority in my time off, enjoying
        mountain biking, hiking and travel—whether with family or solo when needed.
